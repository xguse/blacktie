# run_options is a dictionary that contains variables that will be needed for
# many or all stages of the run
run_options:
    base_dir: nose_test_run
    run_id: testing           #  name your run: if false; uses current date/time for uniqe run_id everytime
    bowtie_indexes_dir: bowtie_indexes

# `tophat_options`:
# -----------------
# This is a dictionary that contains variables needed for all the tophat runs.
# The names of the key:value combinations are taken directly from the tophat
# option names but have the leading '-' removed.

# -o becomes o; --library-type becomes library-type

# **This is true for the cufflinks, cuffmerge, cuffdiff option dictionaries.** 

# `from_conditions`:
# ------------------
# This is a special value that tells blacktie that you don't want to name a single
# value for this option but would rather set the value individually for each of
# your samples/conditions.  If you set the `o` value here: 

#    **all of your different sample results would
#      be written to the same output directory and
#      each would overwrite the next!**
# Hence: from_conditions

# However if you made all of your libraries the same way, things like `r` and
# `mate-std-dev` can be set here to avoid writing the same values over and over
# and perhaps making a mistake or two.

# `positional_args`:
# ------------------
# This is a dictionary inside of the `tophat_options` dictionary.
# It is where you put the arguments to tophat that do not have 'flags' to make
# their identity explicit like `-o path/to/output_dir` or `--library-type fr-unstranded`

# For tophat, these values are 
#     [1] the bowtie index name
#     [2] the fastq files containing the left_reads
#     [3] the fastq files containing the right_reads

# They will be different for cufflinks, cuffmerge, cuffdiff so consult the
# respective help text or manuals, but you should be fine if you just use what
# I have set up in this file already.

# `condition_queue`:
# ------------------
# This is a list of info related to each sample/condition contained in your RNA-sequence
# experiment(s)

# `name`: the name of this condition program. Usually something like a time-point
#         ID or treatment type. Should be as short as possible while still being a useful label. 

# `experiment_id`: this is how you group different experiments to be included in a
#             single cuffmerge/cuffdiff program call.  All conditions in a time
#             series should share the same `experiment_id` and be placed in
#             `condition_queue` in the order that you want them to be sent to
#             cuffdiff.

# `replicate_id`: this is how you group data for biological replicates of a single
#             experimental condition experiments to be included in a cuffdiff program
#             call.  Each replicate of a condition should have a unique `experiment_id`.

# `left_reads`: a list of the paths to fastq files containing left reads for
#               each condition. 

# `right_reads`: list of fastqs containing the right mates for the fastqs in
#                `left_reads`.
#                 **NOTE** right mate file must be in same order as provided to `left_reads`
