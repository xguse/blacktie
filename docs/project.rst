Project Summary
===============

Goals
-----
* Streamline and simplify the complex task of analyzing full RNA-seq experiements using tophat and cufflinks.
* Automatically record settings used and program output messages in a way that users can track them to data.
* Provide base functionality that will allow users to create custom pipelines easily.
* ... *more and better to come* ...

Lessons Learned
---------------
* *watch this space*

Current Features:
-----------------
* simple command line interface allows almost ANYBODY to fully analyze RNA-seq data with tophat/cufflinks
* get email updates through gmail sender address
* run mutiple complex tophat/cufflinks experiements with a single command
* ** and more! **

Future Features:
----------------
* ability to generate SGE qsub-able scripts instead of running the system calls itself
